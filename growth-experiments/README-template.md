# [Experiment Title]

## ðŸŽ¯ Hypothesis
Clear, testable statement of the expected outcome.  
- If we [change X], then we expect [Y metric] to improve by [Z%].  

---

## ðŸ›  Experiment Design
How the test was structured.  
- **Variant A (Baseline):** [Description]  
- **Variant B (Experiment):** [Description]  
- **Success Metrics:** Activation, retention, conversion, etc.  
- **Sample Size / Duration:** Include calculations if relevant.  

---

## ðŸ“Š Measurement
How results are captured and analyzed.  
- Event tracking or SQL queries used.  
- Any mock data or synthetic users.  
- Tools/frameworks applied (e.g., feature flags, A/B platforms).  

---

## ðŸ“ˆ Results (Mock or Real Data)
- Tables or charts comparing control vs experiment.  
- Statistical significance where applicable.  
- Directional insights if not statistically significant.  

---

## ðŸ’¡ Learnings
What did the experiment show?  
- What worked / didnâ€™t work?  
- Whatâ€™s the likely impact on SaaS growth metrics?  

---

## ðŸš€ Next Steps
- Roll out, iterate, or design a follow-up experiment.  
- Document potential risks or watchouts.
