# Growth Experiments

## 🎯 Purpose
This folder contains **experiment designs and technical playbooks** for testing product-led growth (PLG) hypotheses.  
The goal is to document how to structure, measure, and analyze experiments in a SaaS context.

## 📐 Structure
Each experiment is documented as a lightweight playbook:
- **Hypothesis** → Clear statement of the expected outcome.  
- **Design** → Test setup, metrics, and success criteria.  
- **Measurement** → SQL queries or notebooks to evaluate the results.  
- **Learnings** → What the data suggests and how it informs product strategy.  

## 📂 Current & Planned Experiments
- **Onboarding AI vs Baseline** → Comparing guided vs. manual onboarding.  
- **Paywall Conversion** → Testing placement and timing of paywalls.  
- **Referral Loop** → Incentivizing NGO federations to invite other organizations.  
- **Feature Gating** → Evaluating freemium vs. time-limited trial models.  

Each experiment includes design notes and, where relevant, mock analysis to demonstrate expected outputs.
