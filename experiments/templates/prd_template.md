- **Status:** Draft | In Progress | Completed

## 2. Problem & Hypothesis
- **Problem Statement:**  
  What growth problem are we addressing? Include background context and supporting data.

- **Hypothesis:**  
  If we <describe change>, then <metric> will improve because <reason>.

## 3. Metrics & Success Criteria
- **Primary Metric:** e.g., D7 Retention, Activation Rate
- **Guardrail Metrics:** e.g., Churn, Support Tickets, Latency
- **Minimum Detectable Effect (MDE):** e.g., +3% absolute improvement
- **Success Definition:**  
  Ship if the primary metric improves by ≥ MDE with p < 0.05 **and** no guardrail regressions.
