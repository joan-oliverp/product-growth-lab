# Product Growth Lab

**A curated portfolio of SaaS & PLG technical case studies**

*By Joan Oliver Poyatos*

## 📌 Purpose

This repository showcases my hands-on approach to building and scaling **B2B SaaS products with subscription models and product-led growth (PLG)**.

It demonstrates not only strategic thinking as a Head of Product, but also the technical fluency needed to:
* Design event tracking and data models
* Run experiments and analyze product metrics
* Integrate SaaS billing and APIs
* Apply AI for growth, retention, and personalization

All examples are based on my current work with **Escaly** (a SaaS for social impact organizations) and other B2B SaaS learnings. Where real data is not available, I use **mock datasets** to illustrate the approach.

## 📂 Repository Structure
<span style="background-color: grey">**`/tracking-plan-escaly`**</span>
* Event schema in JSON/CSV format
* Documentation of key activation, retention, and monetization events
* Example instrumentation diagrams

👉 Shows ability to define measurable PLG funnels.

<span style="background-color: grey">**`/dashboards`**</span>
* SQL queries for activation, retention, and conversion funnels
* Mock dashboards (Metabase / Looker Studio exports)
* Cohort analysis examples

👉 Demonstrates data fluency and decision-support dashboards.

<span style="background-color: grey">**`/growth-experiments`**</span>
* Experiment design docs in Markdown (hypothesis → setup → evaluation)
* Sample size calculations and statistical significance checks
* Jupyter notebooks simulating A/B test results

👉 Evidence of structured experimentation mindset.

<span style="background-color: grey">**`/billing-sandbox`**</span>
* Test integration with Stripe API (usage-based billing simulation)
* Example scripts and workflows
* Documentation on pricing/packaging strategies

👉 Shows competence in SaaS billing mechanics.

<span style="background-color: grey">**`/ai-for-growth`**</span>

Readable write-ups that combine Escaly and SaaS learnings:
* *“Designing an Activation Funnel for Early-Stage SaaS”*
* *“Testing Freemium vs. Paid Entry in Social Sector SaaS”*
* *“AI-Enabled Retention Strategies for Subscription Platforms”*

👉 Storytelling layer that connects technical work to product strategy.

## 🧩 Why This Portfolio Matters

Hiring for senior product roles often demands evidence of **both leadership and hands-on capability**.
This repo is my way of bridging that gap:
* **Leadership**: I’ve scaled multiple B2B SaaS products from concept to market leadership.
* **Technical**: I can directly design tracking, run SQL, set up billing, and orchestrate AI-driven growth experiments.
