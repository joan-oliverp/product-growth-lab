# Case Study ‚Äî Escaly Retention Cohorts

## üéØ Context
This case study is part of the *Product Manager Technical Skills & PLG Portfolio*.

The goal is to analyze **retention behavior in Escaly**, a B2B SaaS platform that digitalizes psychosocial assessments for social organizations.

The study explores how *team adoption*‚Äîthe number of professionals actively using Escaly within the same organization‚Äîaffects 12-week retention.

---

## üõ† Problem
- Early Escaly usage often remains limited to one enthusiastic professional within an organization.
- Without collaborative use, the platform‚Äôs full value‚Äîshared data, standardized reporting, and collective decision-making‚Äînever materializes.  
- Churn analysis showed that most inactive accounts had only one active user.  
- Escaly‚Äôs mission is inherently collaborative: assessments are interpreted, discussed, and followed up by multidisciplinary teams.  
- Understanding how early multi-user adoption influences long-term retention is essential to improve onboarding and expansion strategy.

---

## üìê Hypothesis
> Organizations where **two or more professionals become active during the first 4 weeks after signup** will show **significantly higher 12-week retention** than organizations with only one active user.

Rationale:
- Collaboration transforms Escaly from an individual tool into a shared workflow.  
- Peers reduce friction by modeling correct use and reinforcing digital habits.  
- Once multiple users depend on shared data, the perceived switching cost increases.

In PLG terms, *team activation* is Escaly‚Äôs equivalent of a **collaboration loop**‚Äîsimilar to inviting teammates in Notion or Miro‚Äîand should correlate with sustained engagement.

## üìä Measurement
**Cohort definition**  
- Cohorts grouped by `signup_week` (organization-level).  
- Observation window: 12 weeks post-signup.  

**Retention metric**
- % of organizations with ‚â• 1 active user in week _n_.  

**Segmentation**
- **Single-user orgs:** 1 active user by week 4  
- **Multi-user orgs:** ‚â• 2 active user by week 4

**Note:**
While Escaly plans to track invitation and sharing events (`user_invited`, `report_shared`) in later phases, this analysis focuses solely on observed collaboration rather than invitation intent.

## Technical Specification
The detailed tracking plan for this analysis is documented separately in:  
[`tracking-plan-extension.md`](./tracking-plan-extension.md)

This supporting file outlines the event schema, governance alignment, and measurement logic for the extended tracking plan that enables team-based retention analysis.

## üìà Results (Mock or Real Data)

### 12-Week Retention by Team Segment

**Retention Curve (mock data)**  
![Escaly ‚Äî 12-Week Retention by Team Segment](./figs/retention_curve.png)

The figure above shows the 12-week retention trajectories for single-user vs. multi-user organizations. Multi-user accounts maintain engagement far longer, while single-user organizations rapidly decay within the first month.

---

### Weighted Retention by Cohort Size

| Cohort Type | Week 1 | Week 4 | Week 8 | Week 12 |
|--------------|--------|--------|--------|---------|
| Single-user orgs (n = 47) | 57.4 % | 6.4 % | 21.3 % | 6.4 % |
| Multi-user orgs (n = 33) | 90.9 % | 81.8 % | 57.6 % | 42.4 % |

### Interpretation

- **Early Engagement Gap (Week 1).** Multi-user organizations retain nearly twice as many active accounts in the first week (90.9 %) compared with single-user accounts (57.4 %). Collaboration clearly accelerates early value realization.
- **Critical Divergence (Week 4).** By week 4, single-user organizations collapse to 6.4 % retention while multi-user orgs still hold 81.8 %. ‚Üí This marks the activation-retention inflection point: if teamwork hasn‚Äôt formed within the first month, churn risk becomes extreme.
- **Mid-Term Stability (Weeks 6‚Äì8).** Multi-user orgs level off around 60 %, a healthy plateau typical of engaged SaaS teams.
Single-user orgs show minor bumps (‚âà 20 %) from sporadic re-use but lack sustained patterns.
- **Long-Term Retention (Week 12).** After three months, 42 % of multi-user organizations remain active versus only 6 % of single-user ones ‚Äî a 7√ó retention advantage driven by team adoption.

## üí° Insights
1. **Team adoption drives retention.**  
   Escaly‚Äôs stickiness emerges once it becomes a shared workflow, not an individual tool.  

2. **Peer influence accelerates digital adoption.**  
   Internal champions succeed when they onboard at least one colleague early‚Äîsocial proof lowers resistance to change.  

3. **Product implication.**  
   Onboarding should explicitly nudge first users to *invite a teammate* and *complete an assessment together*.  
   Collaboration is not a side feature; it‚Äôs the retention engine.

## üöÄ Next Steps
  Future PLG experiments should test:  
  - Auto-prompting invites during first assessment  
  - Shared dashboards and activity notifications  
  - Usage badges (‚Äú2 of your colleagues are active this week‚Äù)  

---

## üîë Why It Matters for PLG
- **Collaboration = Growth loop.**  
  ‚ÄúInvite ‚Üí Collaborate ‚Üí Retain‚Äù defines Escaly‚Äôs compounding engine. Each invitation extends the product‚Äôs reach inside an organization.  

- **Monetization readiness.**  
  Team retention validates a shift from single-seat trials to tiered, organization-based subscriptions‚Äîthe foundation for scalable ARR.  

- **Efficient growth.**  
  A +32 pp increase in team activation can translate into +36 pp improvement in week-12 retention, boosting LTV without new acquisition spend.
