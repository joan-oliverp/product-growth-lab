# Case Studies

## 🎯 Purpose
This folder contains **narrative case studies** that combine product context, structured analysis, and technical artifacts.  
Each case study is written in a professional, concise format that mirrors how product teams document and communicate insights.

## 📐 Structure
Case studies follow a consistent flow:
- **Problem** → What challenge or opportunity was identified.  
- **Hypothesis** → The assumption guiding the experiment or change.  
- **Experiment / Measurement** → How the hypothesis was tested and what was measured.  
- **Results** → Key findings, supported by SQL queries, charts, or mock datasets.  
- **Insights & Next Steps** → Strategic implications for SaaS and PLG growth.  

## 📂 Current & Planned Case Studies
- **Escaly Activation Funnel** → How onboarding design affects activation.  
- **Retention Cohorts for Early SaaS** → Measuring engagement over 12 weeks.  
- **Billing for NGOs** → Designing usage-based billing in conservative markets.  
- **AI for Growth** → Using AI to reduce churn and improve upsell.  

Each case study links to supporting artifacts (tracking plans, SQL notebooks, figures) to show both reasoning and execution.
