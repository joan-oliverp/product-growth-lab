# Business Logic â€” Escaly

## ðŸŽ¯ Purpose
This folder defines the **business logic layer** of Escalyâ€™s analytics.  
It describes *what matters* for growth â€” funnels, the North Star metric, and key product metrics â€” without referencing technical event names or schemas.

By separating business logic from instrumentation, Escaly ensures that product decisions drive measurement, not the other way around.

## ðŸ“‚ Contents
- **business-logic.md** â†’ Canonical definitions of funnels (AARRR), the North Star, and key metrics.

## Relation to Tracking Plan
The **business logic** defines Escalyâ€™s growth framework at a conceptual level.  
The **tracking plan** ([../tracking-plan-escaly](../tracking-plan-escaly)) implements this logic in events, properties, and governance rules.

Together, they form the foundation for case studies and dashboards.
