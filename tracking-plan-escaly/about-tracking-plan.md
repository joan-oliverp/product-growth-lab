# About the Escaly Tracking Plan

## ðŸŽ¯ Purpose
Escalyâ€™s tracking plan defines how product interactions are captured so they can be turned into reliable business metrics.  
It connects **business goals** (activation, retention, North Star) with **clean instrumentation rules** that ensure data quality.

Unlike many teams that keep tracking plans in spreadsheets, Escaly maintains the plan in **JSON + schema**.  
This makes it version-controlled, auditable, and aligned with how modern SaaS companies work.

## ðŸ§­ Design Approach
The plan was shaped by combining three elements:
- **Business logic** â†’ AARRR funnel definitions and the North Star metric (monthly assessments).  
- **Governance** â†’ clear rules for naming, ownership, and PII handling.  
- **Industry practice** â†’ inspired by Segment/Amplitude-style tracking plans, but extended with validation and B2B identifiers.

## ðŸ“‘ Current Scope
For the current phase (Activity 1.1), the plan instruments:
- **Acquisition** â†’ signup start and completion.  
- **Activation** â†’ scale selection, assessment submission, and report generation.  
- **North Star** â†’ monthly completed assessments.  
- **Key metrics** â†’ signup completion rate, acquisition-to-activation rate, activation rate, time to activation, assessment completion, and assessments per active account.

## ðŸš€ Why it Matters
By making the tracking plan explicit and code-based, Escaly shows:
- **Strategic alignment** â†’ product metrics are defined before instrumentation.  
- **Operational discipline** â†’ governance rules enforce consistency and compliance.  
- **Clarity** â†’ artifacts are structured, easy to scan, and directly linked to product growth questions.
